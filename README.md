## Problem Statement
Banks face significant financial loss and operational challenges due to customer churn. Understanding which customer segments are more likely to churn and why they leave is crucial for customer retention strategies. This project seeks to uncover the reasons behind churn and identify at-risk customer profiles.

## Objective
To analyze customer churn in a bank by leveraging customer demographics, product usage, balance, and salary details. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to churn and derive actionable insights to help the business reduce churn rates.

## Methodology
Data Source: Kaggle.com
Data Cleaning: Performed in Microsoft Excel to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.

Visualization Tool: Tableau was used to create an interactive and visually rich dashboard.

Analytical Approach:

Univariate (1D) analysis of key attributes.

Bivariate (2D) and multivariate (3D) correlation studies.

Segmentation analysis based on demographics and behavior.

## Analysis Performed
Independent Variable Evaluation:

Country-wise, gender, age, and product usage distribution.

Assessment of variables like credit card ownership and active membership status.

## Correlation Heatmaps:

Examined relationships between balance and other dimensions such as country, gender, credit card status, and product count.

Scatter Plots:

Visualized churn distribution across dimensions like balance, age, tenure, and credit score.

Group Analysis:

Customers segmented by active status, product number, and balance range.

## Key Insights
Country Impact: Germany shows the highest churn rate (32.44%) compared to France and Spain.

Product Usage: Customers using only 1 product have the highest churn rate (82.71%). Churn significantly drops with more products.

Gender & Age: Female customers churn more than males. Younger customers (18–34) are more prone to churn.

Active Membership: Inactive members have notably higher churn, especially in the 40–50 age group.

Balance Influence:

Customers with balances between 100K–150K exhibit higher churn.

Retention is strongest among those with balances >200K.

Credit Score:

Scores below 400 correlate with a 100% churn rate.

Scores between 500–700 with balance in 100K–150K are most stable.

## Result
The analysis revealed that product usage, active status, balance range, and country are the most significant predictors of churn. These findings can be used by the bank to:

Create targeted retention campaigns for at-risk segments.

Encourage product adoption and active engagement.

Monitor and intervene with customers having mid-range balances and low credit scores.
